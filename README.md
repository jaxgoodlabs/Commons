# About this repository
This is a repository dedicated to the compilation and curation of high-value assets for open source and peer-to-peer communities. Assets are currently organized using an ad hoc structure defined by its contributors. As the project grows and evolves, this structure will be updated and refined to keep pace with the needs and demands of its users. The most current catalog of assets contained will be linked from this document.
